      "question": "Considering the provided descriptions, which of the following scenarios best illustrates the conversion between a graphical and mathematical representation of a signal for comprehensive understanding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Observing the fluctuating electric and magnetic fields from a cellular phone's antenna and then plotting these variations against time to identify patterns.",
        "B": "Receiving a text prompt from a user and then immediately processing it through a chatbot's token dictionary without any visual or mathematical intermediate step.",
        "C": "Looking at a company's stock closing price on a daily chart and then performing complex statistical calculations on the raw numerical data without referencing the visual trend.",
        "D": "Describing a 2D image as a function of spatial coordinates without any visualization or a mathematical equation to represent light intensity."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "ground_truth": "Signal Representation (Pictorial): ** Signals can be visually defined by sketching their graph as a function of time, highlighting the importance of the ability to convert between graphical and mathematical descriptions for comprehensive understanding."

    {
      "question": "The distinction between continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) signals hinges on the nature of their independent variable. Based on the provided context, how would the representation of a signal from a digital camera most closely align with the definitions of CT and DT signals?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It would be considered a continuous-space signal because light intensity varies continuously across its surface.",
        "B": "It would be a discrete-space signal, analogous to a discrete-time signal where the 'time' variable is represented by distinct pixel locations.",
        "C": "It would be a continuous-time signal if the camera captures frames rapidly, and a discrete-time signal if it captures individual moments.",
        "D": "It's fundamentally different from both CT and DT signals as it deals with spatial dimensions rather than temporal ones."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "ground_truth": "Signal Representation (Pictorial): ** Signals can be visually defined by sketching their graph as a function of time, highlighting the importance of the ability to convert between graphical and mathematical descriptions for comprehensive understanding."
